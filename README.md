# Rcode_DMS_boundary_layer
The model version (v0.0.0) is an approximation of DMS cell surface enrichment. This version has been submitted for publication (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.1205466).
The new improved version (v1.0.0) calculates DMS cell surface enrichment relative to the outside edge of the effective boundary layer, which we call the phycosphere (10.5281/zenodo.1217450).
